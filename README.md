# Array.prototype.reduce() to return a sum of numbers
An Express application that serves up an HTML page that allows users to input numeric values.  The values are added together and the sum is returned to the user.
The goal of the project is to use an Array method in the context of an Express app and HTML page (there are simpler ways of adding a list of numbers, so this project is not a recommendation of the reduce() method for that purpose!).
